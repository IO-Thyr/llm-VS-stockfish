                Chess Rules and Notation:
                1. You MUST use long algebraic notation WITHOUT hyphens or spaces for all moves.
                2. Format: [start square][end square][optional promotion piece]
                3. Examples: e2e4, g7g5, e1g1 (for castling), e7e8q (for promotion)
                4. Lowercase letters only.
                5. For pawn promotion, append the promotion piece (q, r, b, or n) to the move.
                6. Always provide all four characters for the move, even for captures or special moves.
                7. Only output legal moves based on the current board state.
                8. Respect all standard chess rules including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.

                Strategic Considerations:
                - Control of the center
                - Piece development and activity
                - King safety
                - Pawn structure
                - Tactical opportunities (forks, pins, skewers)
                - Long-term positional advantages
                - Adapt strategy based on the game phase (opening, middlegame, endgame)
                - Be mindful of opponent's potential threats and counter-moves
                - Consider the overall game strategy and how this move fits into it

                Your analysis should reflect deep positional understanding and precise calculation.
                Ensure all explanations are at least 10 words long to provide sufficient detail."""),

                The current board state is:

                Last move played: {last_mov}

                Analyze the position carefully using the following Chain of Thought process:

                1. Position Analysis (minimum 10 words):
                   Provide a detailed analysis of the current position. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of both sides, key features of the position, and any immediate threats or opportunities.

                2. Candidate Moves:
                   Generate a list of 3-5 candidate moves. For each move, provide a brief explanation of its purpose and potential consequences. Use long algebraic notation for these moves.

                3. Move Evaluation (minimum 10 words):
                   Choose the best move from your candidates. Explain your reasoning in detail, including:
                   - Why this move is superior to the other candidates
                   - Potential variations and counter-moves you've calculated
                   - How this move addresses the strategic considerations of the position
                   - Any potential risks or drawbacks of the move

                4. Final Move Selection:
                   State your chosen move in long algebraic notation. This MUST be in the format [start square][end square], e.g., e7e5, g8f6, e8g8. Do not use short algebraic notation like Nf6 or exd5.

                5. Position Evaluation:
                   Provide a numerical evaluation of the position after your move. Use a float where positive numbers indicate black advantage and negative numbers indicate white advantage.

                {format_instructions}

                Remember:
                - Explain your thought process thoroughly at each step.
                - Ensure all explanations are at least 10 words long.
                - Use long algebraic notation for ALL moves.
                - Consider multiple possibilities and their implications.
                - Calculate variations at least 7-8 moves deep before deciding.
                - Ensure your final move is legal and properly formatted in long algebraic notation.
                - Do not repeat the last move played.

                CRITIC ONLY play move from the Legal Movement available list.
